## Overview

You'll write plenty of code this semester, but before you get to it you first
need to learn how to edit, test, and submit your work. We'll cover those steps
here.

To keep this writeup short we'll do lots of interactive demonstrations, but the
critical steps and commands will be  documented for future reference.

## `fourier.cs.iit.edu`

At this point you should've received an e-mail containing login credentials for
`fourier.cs.iit.edu`, a CS department Linux server on which you work on machine
problems for this class. Using fourier will ensure a consistent working
environment, and we will be using a comparable system to evaluate your
submissions. If you're interested in working on your own Linux machine (or
virtual machine), this is possible for many of the labs -- please just get in
touch and we'll help you set things up.

To log in to fourier, you'll need an SSH client. At a terminal on most computers
running Linux, macOS, or Windows 10, you can do this with the command:

    ssh username@fourier.cs.iit.edu

On Windows you may need to download a separate SSH client such as [PuTTY][] if
you don't have a command line client.

[PuTTY]: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

After logging in, resist the overwhelming urge to immediately start being
productive! Repeat after me: TERMINAL MULTIPLEXERS ARE AWESOME. You'll learn
about them next.

## tmux

MPs require multiple coding, testing, and debugging sessions to complete, which
require multiple corresponding login sessions on fourier. Each time you login,
you'll have to navigate into the appropriate work directory, re-open source
file(s) in editors, start up debugging sessions, run trace files to obtain
output, etc. All before you can even *think* about getting work done.

Ugh.

All the above constitute annoying *cognitive overhead*, and we can all use less
of that (especially given how difficult it is for most students to allocate time
to sit down and work on coursework in the first place).

Wouldn't it be great if you could set things up --- your editing windows,
debuggers, trace output position --- *just the way you like it*, ***one time***,
then have it remain that way each time you log back in? Heck yeah. That's where
terminal multiplexers fit in.

Technically, a terminal multiplexer is a program that:

1. Allows you to create and manage multiple terminal sessions from a single
   screen. You can run a different program in each session (e.g., editor,
   debugger, shell).
2. Continues to run after you log out, so when you reconnect you can simply pick
   up where you left off.

Less technically, a terminal multiplexer = bliss.

To start tmux, just use the command `tmux`. I'll walk you through a few demo
sessions, but the important keys are as follows:

- `C-b`: default prefix key (prefixes all following command keys)
- `c`: create a new window
- `n`/`p`: change to the next/previous window
- `"`: split the current window
- `<space>`: arrange the panes in the current window according to some preset
- `o`: change to the next pane in the current window
- `!`: break the current pane out of the current window 
- `?`: list all key bindings
- `d`: detach from tmux

After detaching from a session, the following command will re-attach you to it
(given that you only have one tmux session running):

    tmux at

You should **NOT** create a new tmux session (with the command `tmux`) each time you
log in. Instead, you need only do this once --- on subsequent logins you will
simply reattach to your existing session with `tmux at`.

So... Logged in: check. tmux session attached: check. Moving on.

## Git / Github

[Git][] is a [distributed version control system][better-explained-dvcs], and
[Github][] is a Git repository hosting service. You'll use the first to
manage all your code and the second to share it with me.

Start by claiming your repository for lab 1 on GitHub via [this invitation
link](https://classroom.github.com/a/3byqf3Ru). You'll be prompted to
create an account on Github (or sign in, if you already have one), and then
you'll be asked to pick your username from a list --- please locate and select
your IIT Hawk ID and accept the assignment. When the process is complete, you
should be taken to a URL that looks something like this (where *USER* is your
own Github username):

    https://github.com/cs351/mp-prelim-USER

This is your repository's homepage on Github. You can always come back here to
see the status of your work as reflected on Github. When we ask you to submit
work you will push it here, and we will pull work from this Github repository
for grading. Remember, if your work isn't here we can't see it!

---

Next, you should clone your repository on fourier so you can work on and make
changes to it. On your repository's Github page, you should see a green button
labeled "Clone or download". Click it and copy the URL in the textfield. 

When logged in to fourier, run the following command, replacing the URL with the
one you just copied:

    git clone https://github.com/cs351/mp-prelim-USER.git    

This will prompt you for your Github username and password. If successful, you
will see output like the following:

    remote: Enumerating objects: 151, done.
    remote: Counting objects: 100% (151/151), done.
    remote: Compressing objects: 100% (103/103), done.
    remote: Total 151 (delta 6), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
    Receiving objects: 100% (151/151), 3.59 MiB | 3.10 MiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (6/6), done.
    Checking connectivity... done.

The command will also create a folder named "mp-prelim-USER", in which you will
find files and numbered directories corresponding to the machine problems for
this class. 

## Editing files

A good programmer has strong opinions about programming languages, coding
conventions, and text editors. There are only two UNIX text editors worth
learning: [Emacs][] and [Vim][]. Both are installed on fourier. [Pick
one][emacs-vs-vi] and learn a new feature every day.

You can also use an editor or IDE on your own computer to edit files remotely on
fourier. Editors/IDEs such as [Atom](https://atom.io) and [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) have good support for such workflows. Feel
free to reach out for help setting them up.

## Signing your project header

Open and read the "main.c" file located in your newly cloned repository.
You'll find a header comment at the top, which you should edit and replace with
your own name, IIT email address, AID, and today's date. After doing this, save your changes.

When done, you can commit your changes to the repository with the following
command:

    git commit -am "Signing honor pledge"

What this command does is save a record of your changes to the repository,
annotated with the message in double quotes. Everytime you make a substantive
set of changes to one or more files in your repository you should commit your
work with a short, descriptive commit message. 

One great thing about commits is that you can easily compare the differences
between them (or between a commit and the current state of your files, known as
the "working tree"). This can be a real lifesaver if you accidentally introduce
a bug into your code and want to see what you changed since the last commit, or
even just roll back all your changes entirely.

Commits are not automatically sent to Github, however. To do that, you need to
run this next command:

    git push

After entering your Github username and password, you should see output that
looks like this:

    Counting objects: 5, done.
    Delta compression using up to 12 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 318 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
    Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
    remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
    To https://github.com/cs351/mp-prelim-USER.git
        b0bf469..9b59620  master -> master

This tells you that all your commits have now been synchronized with your
repository on Github, and we can pull them for grading. In the future, you'll
need to push your commits whenever you're done working on a given machine
problem and want to make your work available to us. 

## Building

You'll write code in the next machine problem. Promise. This time we'll skip
that part and jump to the fun parts: building and running.

For the rest of this machine problem you'll work in the "00-prelim" subdirectory
of your repository. In there, you'll find these files:

- "Makefile": more on this later
- "hello.h" and "hello.c": files that declare and define the `say_hello_to` API
- "main.c": contains the definition of the `main` function

Let's try to compile "main.c" (the `$` indicates the shell prompt, and is
followed by the command you should enter):

    $ gcc main.c
    /tmp/ccbmZeXz.o: In function `main':
    main.c:(.text+0x24): undefined reference to `say_hello_to'
    main.c:(.text+0x30): undefined reference to `say_hello_to'
    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

Didn't work. (Why not?)

Try compiling "hello.c":

    $ gcc hello.c
    /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.4.7/../../../../lib64/crt1.o: In function `_start':
    (.text+0x20): undefined reference to `main'
    collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

What gives?

Now try:

    $ gcc hello.c main.c

Good. No errors. The compiler created an executable for you named "a.out", by
default. Run it:

    $ ./a.out 
    Hello world!
    $ ./a.out Master
    Hello Master!

We can of course rename the executable, but let's have the compiler put it in
the right place for us:

    $ rm a.out
    $ gcc -o hello hello.c main.c
    $ ./hello Overlord
    Hello Overlord!

But what about the multi-stage compilation and linking process discussed in
class? This is actually going on behind the scenes already (try invoking gcc
with the `-v` flag to see what it's doing). To build the intermediate object
files and link them together in separate steps, do:

    $ gcc -c hello.c
    $ gcc -c main.c
    $ gcc -o hello hello.o main.o

See how we're referring to the ".o" files in the third step? Those are the
object files that were generated when we invoked gcc with the `-c` flag, which
tells it to stop before the linking step. 

If the project being built is complex enough, it may be necessary to separate
the final linking step from the creation of a multitude of intermediate object
files. Manually invoking the compiler in such situations is a real pain, and
definitely not something we'd want to keep doing!

Enter the standard C build tool: **make**

## make

`make` is used to automate builds. Try it out (first, we delete the files we
previously built):

    $ rm -f *.o hello
    $ make
    gcc -g -Wall -O2   -c -o hello.o hello.c
    gcc -g -Wall -O2   -c -o main.o main.c
    gcc -g -Wall -O2 -o hello hello.o main.o

Woohoo! There's automation for you! Try it again:

    $ make
    make: Nothing to be done for `all'.

`make` knows that no files have changed since we last build the executable,
see. We can update the timestamp of one of the files (using `touch`) to force a
rebuild:

    $ touch hello.c
    $ make
    gcc -g -Wall -O2   -c -o hello.o hello.c
    gcc -g -Wall -O2 -o hello hello.o main.o 

See how it only rebuilds one of the intermediate object files? Pretty nifty.

We can also ask it to run a test for us, then clean up generated files:

    $ make test
    Running test...
    ./hello tester
    Hello tester!
    $ make clean
    rm -f hello.o main.o  hello

## Makefiles

`make` is not magical, of course --- it makes use of the provide "Makefile" to
determine what action(s) to take, depending on the specified target. For
reference, here are the contents of said Makefile. Note the four targets (`all`,
`hello`, `test`, and `clean`), two of which we invoked explicitly before --- the
first target (`all`), it turns out, is used by default when we ran the `make`
command with no argument.

    CC      = gcc
    CFLAGS  = -g -Wall -O2
    SRCS    = hello.c main.c
    OBJS    = $(SRCS:.c=.o) 

    all: hello

    hello: $(OBJS)
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o hello $(OBJS)

    test: hello
        @echo "Running test..."
        ./hello tester

    clean:
        rm -f $(OBJS) hello

We'll go over as much of this during our lab demo as we can, but you should
check out the [GNU `make` manual][gnu-make] for details --- at the very least,
skim through the [Introduction][]. 

## Finishing up

To earn the points for this machine problem, you must have **signed and
committed your "main.c" file and pushed your changes to the Github repository**.
The procedure for doing this is similar in most future labs, so be sure you know
how to do this!

Procedural takeways:

1. Commit often (`git commit -am "Commit message"`), and push to submit (`git push`)
3. `make` to build, and often times some variation on `make test` to run a
   hardcoded test.
